# Project Overview
Simultaneous measurements of top-down attention in brainstem and cortex using EEG
- We are combining two previous EEG paradigms that allow us to simultaneously measure the effect of attention both subcortically and cortically.
- The engineered stimulus allows us to quantify how strongly attention to one sound stream modulates neural responses at different neural processing stages.
- Specifically, the careful design of the competing streams uses different acoustic carrier frequency “pips”, whose periodic repetition produces the pitch percepts of each stream. Because the two competing streams have different carrier frequencies, they excite distinct, non-overlapping portions of the cochlea. In addition, they are temporally offset, to allow us to isolate cortical and subcortical responses to each stream. Finally, the two streams are presented dichotically, in different ears, to ensure there are no cochlear interactions of the competing streams.
